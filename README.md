# App Review Code

Simple code to allow the gathering and processing of public reviews of apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store APIs.

## The Apple App Store Review API
Reviews on published apps in the Apple App store are openly available. A limited number of reviews can be accessed via a rss call to: 

https://itunes.apple.com/{country}/rss/customerreviews/page={page no}/id={your app id}/sortBy=mostRecent/json

- country is the App Store country where you sell it, e.g. gb
- page no is the page of the data to return - data is from paginated
- app id is the number following "id" in the App Store URL

The example Python code calls the API the requests library. The resulting nested JSON is flattened and saves as a CSV file.

## The Google Play Store Review API
The Google Play reviews are accessed via the Play Console using a private key using oauth2. This should be generated by the app administrator on the Google Play Console
